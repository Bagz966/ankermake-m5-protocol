# Ankermake M5 Protocol

Welcome! This repository contains `ankerctl.py`, a command-line interface for
monitoring, controlling and interfacing with Ankermake M5 3D printers.

NOTE: This software is in early stages, so expect sharp edges and occasional errors!

The `ankerctl` program uses [`libflagship`](documentation/libflagship.md), a
library for communicating with the numerous different protocols required for
connecting to an Ankermake M5 printer. The `libflagship` library is also maintained
in this repo, under [`libflagship/`](libflagship/).

## Current features

 - Connect to Ankermake M5 and Ankermake APIs without using closed-source Anker
   software.

 - Send raw gcode commands directly to the printer (and see the response)

 - Low-level access to MQTT, PPPP and HTTPS APIs

## Upcoming and planned features

 - Send print jobs to the printer

 - Stream camera image/video to your computer

 - Easily monitor print status

 - Integration into other software. Home Assistant? Prusa Slicer?

Pull requests always welcome :-)

## Installation instructions

First, please follow the [installation
instructions](documentation/example-file-usage/example-file-prerequistes.md) for
your platform.

Verify that you can start `ankerctl.py`, and get the help screen:

```powershell
## For Windows, use:
python3 ankerctl.py -h
```

```sh
## Linux and MacOS:
./ankerctl.py -h
```

You should see this output:
```
Usage: ankerctl.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  -k, --insecure  Disable TLS certificate validation
  -v, --verbose   Increase verbosity
  -q, --quiet     Decrease verbosity
  -h, --help      Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  config  View and update configuration
  http    Low-level http api access
  mqtt    Low-level mqtt api access
  pppp    Low-level pppp api access
```

Before you can use ankerctl, you need to import the configuration.

Support for logging in with username and password is not yet supported, but an
`auth_token` can be imported from the saved credentials found in `login.json` in
Ankermake Slicer. See `ankerctl.py config import -h` for details:

```
Usage: ankerctl.py config import [OPTIONS] path/to/login.json

  Import printer and account information from login.json

  When run without filename, attempt to auto-detect login.json in default
  install location

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.
```

On Windows and MacOS, the default location of `login.json` will be tried if no
filename is specified. Otherwise, you can specify the file path for
`login.json`. Example for linux:

```sh
ankerctl.py config import ~/.wine/drive_c/users/username/AppData/Local/AnkerMake/AnkerMake_64bit_fp/login.json
```

The expected output is similar to this:
```
[*] Loading cache..
[*] Initializing API..
[*] Requesting profile data..
[*] Requesting printer list..
[*] Requesting pppp keys..
[*] Adding printer [AK7ABC0123401234]
[*] Finished import
```

At this point, your config is saved to a configuration file managed by
`ankerctl.py`. To see an overview of the stored data, use `config show`:

```sh
./ankerctl.py config show
[*] Account:
    user_id: 01234567890abcdef012...<REDACTED>
    email:   bob@example.org
    region:  eu

[*] Printers:
    sn: AK7ABC0123401234
    duid: EUPRAKM-001234-ABCDE
```

NOTE: The cached login info contains sensitive details. In particular, the
`user_id` field is used when connecting to MQTT servers, and essentially works
as a password. Thus, the end of the value is redacted when printed to screen, to avoid
accidentally disclosing sensitive information.

Now that the printer information is known to `ankerctl`, the tool is ready to use.

Some examples:

```sh
# attempt to detect printers on local network
./ankerctl.py pppp lan-search

# monitor mqtt events
./ankerctl.py mqtt monitor

# start gcode prompt
./ankerctl.py mqtt gcode

# set printer name
./ankerctl.py mqtt rename-printer BoatyMcBoatFace
```


## Docker

While running the python script is generally prefered, there may be situations where you want a more portable solution. For this, a docker image is provided.

```sh
docker build -t ankerctl . --no-cache
```

Example usage (no peristent storage)
```bash
docker run \
  -v "$HOME/Library/Application Support/AnkerMake/AnkerMake_64bit_fp/login.json:/tmp/login.json" \
  ankerctl config decode /tmp/login.json
```

Example usage (with peristent storage)
```bash
# create volume where we can store configs
docker volume create ankerctl_vol

# generate /root/.config/ankerctl/default.json which is mounted to the docker volume
docker run \
  -v ankerctl_vol:/root/.config/ankerctl \
  -v "$HOME/Library/Application Support/AnkerMake/AnkerMake_64bit_fp/login.json:/tmp/login.json" \
  ankerctl config import /tmp/login.json

# Now that there is a /root/.config/ankerctl/default.json file that persists in the docker volume
# we can run ankerctl without having to specify the login.json file
docker run \
  -v ankerctl_vol:/root/.config/ankerctl \
  ankerctl config show
```
